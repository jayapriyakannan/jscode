//Var and let declares any type of values
//const also declares any types of values but value is always constant


//var - Declare any type of values - does  allows to redeclare the same variable again and again and reassign as well
//var  scopr is local to whole function but not to a specific block however Let declaration is confined only to the block 

//let -Declare any type of value - does not allows to redeclare the same variable but allows reassigns - ES6
//Let scope confines to a specific block
//It allows variables to be hoisted however will get intialised only at the line of code if used earlier u will get reference error 

//hoisting is important to ensure the order of execution of code
